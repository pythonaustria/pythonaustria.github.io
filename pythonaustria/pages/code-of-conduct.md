## Pledge
As a member of the Python Austria Slack, you pledge to making participation in the community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, race, gender identity and expression, sexual identity and orientation, body size, disability, personal appearance, nationality, religion, level of experience or technical preferences.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior which contributes to creating a positive environment include:

  * using welcoming and inclusive language
  * being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
  * gracefully accepting constructive feedback
  * showing empathy and kindness towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

  * the use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
  * trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal attacks
  * harassment, intimidation, threats
  * publishing others' private information without *explicit* permission; this includes any sort of "outing" of another's identity without their consent
  * publishing screenshots or quotes of interactions from this Slack without all involved users' *explicit* permission
  * publishing of private communication that is not part of a report of a Code of Conduct violation
  * attempts to suggest that "reverse-isms" are violations of the CoC; examples include "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", "cisphobia" etc.
  * offering *unsolicited* explanations, particularly regarding tech subjects; ask before you teach instead of assuming to know what other people don't know
  * [feigning or exaggerating surprise](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise) when someone admits they do not know something
  * "[well-actuallies](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)"
  * other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting

## Enforcement
If you witness a Code of Conduct violation, do the following:

  1. let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s)
  2. the person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue
  3. if this does not happen, or if you are uncomfortable with speaking up, contact the admins with the **/admin** command so they can look into the matter (and, if necessary, issue a warning, block or ban)

When reporting, please include any relevant details (links, screenshots, additional context) so the admins can better understand what happened.

### Admin Actions 
Steps admins will take for further enforcement, as soon as they are available:

  1. repeat the request to stop
  2. edit or remove the offending contents if the person responsible for them refuses to do so themselves; the offender will also be given an official warning
  3. temporarily block the offender from participating in the Slack for a period of time
  4. ban the offender longer-term if the behavior continues or is repeated after the temporary block

## Enforcement Examples

### The Best Case

> Alex: "Company X's tagline is really lame."

> Julia: "Hey, I agree with what I think you're trying to say, but could you not use that word? What about 'is really uncool'?"

> Alex: "oh sorry, sure." -> edits old comment to say "is really unfunny"

### The Admin Case

Sometimes you need to get admins involved, who will do their best to resolve conflicts.

> Patt: "5 years later and $code_editor is still the worst! Anyone who uses it probably sucks at their job."

> Michi: "uhm, could you dial it back a bit? there's a CoC thing about attacking folks' tech use like that..."

> Patt: "LOL what? I'm not attacking anyone, what's your problem?"

> Chris (contacts the admin team privately): "/admins Hi there, can someone look at what's going on in here? Patt is getting a bit aggro... Michi already tried to nudge them about it, but that was of no help."

> AdminPerson (comments in channel): "Hey Patt, admin here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this Slack."

> Patt: "Ehh, leave me alone, I haven't said anything bad, WTF is wrong with you"

> AdminPerson (direct messages Patt): "@Patt I'm being serious. Refer to the CoC over at $URL_to_CodeofConduct and consider this is a warning. I'd appreciate it if you reworded your messages in the channel since they made folks who saw them uncomfortable. Let's try and be kind, yah?"

> Patt (direct messages AdminPerson): "@AdminPerson Yeah, sorry. I had a really bad day at work and I'm also super stressed with a private matter, and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Michi to apologise and will edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble. :/"

> AdminPerson (direct messages Patt): "@Patt Thank you. I hear you on stressful personal stuff. Wishing you a better day at work tomorrow."
